# Part 2 : Basic Selectors

As I mentioned in the previous post, CSS has five categories of selectors. The basic category includes the Universal Selector (*), Tag selectors, Id selectors, and Class selectors. Now, let's get to know each of them.

## 1. Universal Selector

It is denoted by an asterisk(*). This selector selects all the elements on a webpage. For example:

{% codepen https://codepen.io/thecodergirl18/pen/vYNQGba default-tab=css,result %}
	
A most common example that you have seen of the Universal Selector is,
	
<p>

</p>
	
This snippet removes browser default margin and padding of all the elements on a webpage.
	
## 2. Tag selector

It selects all HTML elements with the specified tag name. 

For example: to select all divs on a webpage using the tag name, we simply write, 

{% codepen https://codepen.io/thecodergirl18/pen/yLYQJLJ default-tab=css,result %}
	
## 3. ID selector

It selects an HTML element with a unique name. A unique name is given to an HTML element in the *"id"* attribute of the element. The element can then be styled by using the id preceded with a *hash(#)* symbol. 

{% codepen https://codepen.io/thecodergirl18/pen/oNjQLXy default-tab=css,result %}
	
***Note:*** *Id is a unique name so, no two elements can have the same id.*
	
## 4. Class selector

A class selector selects a group of HTML elements having the same name. A class name can be given to multiple HTML elements in the *"class"* attribute of every element that you want to be part of the group. The elements can then be styled by using the class name preceded with a *dot(.)* symbol. 

For Example: 

{% codepen https://codepen.io/thecodergirl18/pen/ExVOyPb default-tab=css,result %}

# Combining the Basic Selectors

All the basic selectors can also be used in combination with each other as per requirements. These combinations are other than the *Combinator Selectors* and no other symbol is required to combine them. 

### Example 1: To select all the p elements inside the div with class *"red"*, we can use 

{% codepen https://codepen.io/thecodergirl18/pen/JjYeKKL default-tab=css,result %}

### Example 2: To select all divs with class name *"teal"*, we can use 

{% codepen https://codepen.io/thecodergirl18/pen/mdeQEOg default-tab=css,result %}

### Example 3: We can also use a combination in which multiple tag names or class names or ids are separated by a comma, to apply styling to all those elements i.e.

</p>

Here's the example for this, 
			
{% codepen https://codepen.io/thecodergirl18/pen/dyYQXvQ default-tab=css,result %}

These are just a few examples and these selectors can be combined in a lot of ways.

Although basic selectors are easy to use, there can be issues of the precedence so, they must be used with care. The topic is itself a bit detailed so I may be writing something on it in the future. For now, at least basic selectors are making sense hopefully.ðŸ˜„

In the next post, I will be explaining Combinator Selectors.
