# Part 3 : Combinators

In the previous post, I described that there are four basic selectors in CSS, *universal Selector*, *id selector*, *class selector*, and the *tag/element selector*.

Now there are some selectors that make use of a space or a symbol in between any combination of other kinds of selectors. These are called *Combinators* because the symbols are used to combine the selectors.

According to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp), there are four combinators:
1. Descendant Selector (space)
2. Child Selector (>)
3. Adjacent Sibling Selector (+) 
4. General Sibling Selector (~) 

Here's how each of them works.

## 1. Descendant Selector (space)
This selector selects all the elements that are descendants of any given element. Descendent means any element that is enclosed ***anywhere*** inside a given element whether it is the direct child or enclosed inside a child element.

For example, 
```html
<!-- The outer div -->
<div>
    <p>I am p1. I am inside the outer div</p>
    
    <!-- The inner div-->
    <div>
        <p>I am p2. I am inside the inner div</p>
    </div>

</div>
```

Here are 2 paragraph tags that are enclosed inside the *outer div*. *p1* is the direct child of the *outer div* while *p2* is enclosed inside the *inner div* which itself is the child of the *outer div*. Both *p1* and *p2* are the descendants of the *outer div*. To select both of these paragraphs, we use:

</p>

## 2. Child Selector (>)
Unlike descendant selector, this selects all the children of a given element **but not the descendants**.

For example,
```html
<!-- The outer div -->
<div>
    <p>I am p1. I am the direct child of the outer div</p>
    
    <!-- The inner div-->
    <section>
        <p>I am p2. I am the descendent of the outer div</p>
    </section>

</div>
```
Here are 2 paragraph tags that are enclosed inside the div. Only *p1* is the direct child of the *div* element while *p2* is the descendent of *div* because it is enclosed inside the *section* element which itself is the child of *div*. So, this will select only *p1*.

</p>

## 3. Adjacent Sibling Selector (+) 
This selects the adjacent element of a given element. An adjacent element is one that immediately follows the given element.

For example,
```html
<h1>I am h1</h1>
<p>I am a paragraph right next to h1</p>
<p>I am a paragraph but not right next to h1</p>
```
Now this will select only the first paragraph that is present immediately after *h1*.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ujalak1812/Blogs/master/images/codepen9.PNG" />
</p>

## 4. General Sibling Selector (~) 
Unlike Adjacent Sibling Selector, this selector selects all the siblings of a given selector whether they are right next to the given element or not.

For Example,
```html
<div>
    <h1>I am h1</h1>
    <p>I am a paragraph right next to h1</p>
    <p>I am a paragraph but not right next to h1</p>
</div>
<p>I am a paragraph, not a sibling of h1</p>
```
This will select both paragraphs inside *div* that are the siblings of *h1*.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ujalak1812/Blogs/master/images/codepen10.PNG" />
</p>

.

So, these are the four combinators that are indeed very useful. Just like I have used them with tags here, combinators can also be used in combination with class, id, and all the other selectors.
