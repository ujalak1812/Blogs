# Part 1 : An Introduction

Ever wondered how a program written in JavaScript runs and does its job? To be able to become a better JavaScript developer, It's useful if one knows about the *whys* and *hows* of the execution in JavaScript along with mastering the syntax. 

# So, What happens to the JavaScript Code in the Browser?ðŸ˜•

JavaScript is always hosted in some environment i.e. Browser, Web Server, etc where JavaScript runs. 

The host has a JavaScript engine that takes the code and executes it. A JavaScript engine is a program that executes JavaScript code. There are many different engines out there like: Google's *"V8 engine"* used in *Google Chrome*, Mozilla's *"SpiderMonkey"* used in *Firefox*, etc. 

The engine executes the code with the help of a parser. The Parser knows JavaScript rules. It reads the code line by line to validate if it is written correctly. If the code has mistakes, the parser throws an error and stops execution. Otherwise, it forms a data structure called abstract syntax tree which is then translated into machine code, the code which runs and does its work.

# Now, How the Browser does all of this?ðŸ¤”

Well, it's a game of a few things that happen behind the scenes whenever the browser *(considering for now)* encounters JavaScript code. Those few things are:

- The Execution Contexts
- The Execution Stack

I will be breaking each of these concepts into separate posts, so for now, here is the brief overview of each of them.

## 1. The Execution Context
<p>
    An Execution Context is a container like structure that contains variables, objects and functions, inside or associated with it. It is responsible for the evaluation and execution of the code.

## 2. The Execution Stack
<p>
    Whenever a function call is encountered in the code, a new execution context is formed and is stacked on top of the current execution context forming the Execution Stack.

In the next post, I will be talking about the formation and destruction of the execution stack before going in depths of the execution context which itself is a vast topic.ðŸ’»
