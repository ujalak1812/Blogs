# Part 2 : The Execution Stack Formation & Destruction

In my Last post, I described that all the JavaScript code has some container like structures known as the ***Execution Contexts*** which is responsible for the execution of code.

    <strong><em>a simple Execution Context</em></strong>
    <br>
</p>

Now let's see how an Execution Context does its job.

The browser window is the default and the global execution context because all the code (variables/functions) that is not inside of any other function is executed here, in the global context. The global execution context is associated with the global object, which is the ***window object*** in case of the browser. Everything that is declared in this execution context gets attached to the window object. This is the ***active*** Execution context when code starts running.

Whenever a function call is encountered in the code, a new execution context is formed and is stacked on top of the current execution context forming the Execution Stack. The newly created Execution Context is associated with the function that has been called and contains variables for that function inside it. It also has access to its parent's variables and functions. For the duration of the function call, this execution context becomes the active context where the code for the function is executed.

    <strong><em>Function's Execution context stacked on global one</em></strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

If on the way, there comes another function call within the current one, a new Execution Context is stacked on top of the current active context and it is associated with the new function call.

    <br>
    <strong><em>Execution context of new function stacked on previous one</em></strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

This is how the execution stack works, 
- Bottom-up formation when encountered a function within the current function
- Top-down execution and removal of contexts

I hope all of this makes sense.ðŸ™Œ

In the next post, I will be demonstrating the formation and destruction of the execution stack with a code example.ðŸ’»
